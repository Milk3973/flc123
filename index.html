                            My journey as an educator began long before my
                            tenure within the Department of Education (DOE).
                            Prior to joining the DOE, I operated a daycare for
                            seven years and authored two children's books,
                            "You Are" and "Imagine," which I self-published. In
                            addition to my entrepreneurial pursuits, I initiated
                            a community garden project and actively engaged with
                            children at the local community center and
                            elementary school.
                        </p>
                        <p class="hero-text">
                            During this time, I also conducted workshops on
                            writing, character development, and anti-bullying
                            efforts in collaboration with the community center
                            and elementary schools. My entry into the DOE
                            followed a less conventional path, starting as a
                            substitute teacher while pursuing my Master's degree
                            in General and Special Education.

                        <p class="hero-text" style="margin-bottom: 10px;">My
                            transition to full-time teaching
                            coincided with the onset of the COVID-19 pandemic
                            and a period of social unrest marked by protests and
                            riots. Despite these challenges, I embraced remote
                            teaching with resilience and creativity, striving to
                            maintain a supportive and engaging learning
                            environment for my students. This period underscored
                            my commitment to adaptability and innovative
                            teaching strategies in the face of adversity.</p>

                                The purpose of education, as articulated by
                                Cohen
                                (2014), takes a philosophical approach, rooted
                                in
                                the aims and aspirations of
                                "our 'Founding Fathers'"
                                (p. 43). He posits that K-12 education,
                                including
                                character education, aims to foster skills,
                                knowledge, and dispositions that form the basis
                                for
                                the ability to love, work, and participate in a
                                democracy (p. 43). Similarly, the role of an
                                educator parallels that of a parent, guiding
                                children through the world by both telling and
                                showing them, providing hands-on experiences
                                that
                                connect learning to real-life issues. This
                                approach
                                not only equips students with career-relevant
                                skills
                                but also imbues their future endeavors with
                                purpose
                                (Alismail & McGuire, 2015).
                                <br><br>
                                In my personal philosophy of education, key
                                principles such as patience, understanding,
                                fairness, and familial influence guide my
                                practice.
                                Acknowledging the diverse family dynamics from
                                which
                                students emerge is essential, as it profoundly
                                shapes their identity and educational journey.
                                Fairness, in treating each child equitably while
                                catering to their individual needs, builds trust
                                and
                                ensures that no student feels overlooked or
                                marginalized. Drawing from my own experiences as
                                a
                                student, I recognize the importance of attentive
                                teaching that values every student's voice and
                                potential.

                                Working with children entails affording them the
                                space to make mistakes, learn, and grow.
                                Patience is
                                paramount in navigating challenges, allowing for
                                the
                                fostering of critical thinking skills through
                                open-ended questioning. Dewey's philosophy
                                underscores the importance of teaching children
                                how
                                to think rather than what to think, facilitating
                                continuous reconstruction of experience (Hall,
                                Quinn, & Gollnick, 2014). Understanding how each
                                student learns enables tailored instruction that
                                maximizes their potential, emphasizing
                                engagement
                                and authentic learning experiences.
                                <br><br>
                                Furthermore, embracing diversity in the
                                classroom
                                enriches the learning environment, providing
                                opportunities for cultural exchange and
                                understanding. Recognizing the various learning
                                styles and backgrounds of students fosters
                                inclusive
                                teaching practices that promote trust and
                                respect.
                                Addressing disparities stemming from
                                socioeconomic
                                status, family structure, or cultural
                                differences
                                requires sensitivity and proactive support to
                                ensure
                                that every child has equal access to educational
                                opportunities.
                                <br><br>
                                In conclusion, effective teaching transcends a
                                one-size-fits-all approach, acknowledging the
                                multifaceted nature of student identity and
                                experience. By embracing diversity and
                                individuality, educators can create inclusive
                                learning environments that nurture curiosity,
                                understanding, and academic success.

                    teachers, and
                    students forms the cornerstone of a successful educational
                    journey. When parents are actively engaged in their child's
                    schooling, they gain insight into their academic progress,
                    challenges, and achievements. This
                    collaboration allows
                    teachers to tailor their instruction to meet individual
                    needs, fostering a supportive learning environment.
                    Moreover, students benefit from the consistent message
                    conveyed by both home and school, reinforcing the importance
                    of education and encouraging a sense of responsibility for
                    their learning. By embracing open and transparent
                    communication, parents, teachers, and students form a
                    cohesive team dedicated to academic excellence and personal
                    growth.

                    Additionally, I involve students in preparing materials for
                    their families by assigning projects or presentations that
                    require them to communicate their learning and achievements.
                    This not only enhances student engagement but also empowers
                    them to take ownership of their education and share their
                    progress with their families.

                    about student
                    progress, I implement a transparent communication system
                    that includes regular updates on grades, assessments, and
                    behavior. Students play a key role in designing this system,
                    providing input on how they prefer to showcase their
                    progress and what information they believe is important for
                    their families to know. By involving students in the
                    process, we create a more personalized and meaningful
                    communication approach.

                        height="400px"> I prioritize
                    professionalism and cultural sensitivity. I actively listen
                    to their concerns, validate their perspectives, and strive
                    to find solutions collaboratively. I make efforts to
                    understand and respect the cultural backgrounds and values
                    of each family, adapting my communication style and approach
                    accordingly. Building trust and rapport with families is
                    paramount, and I ensure that every interaction is conducted
                    with empathy, respect, and a genuine commitment to
                    addressing their needs and concerns.

                        In my 12:1:1 class, students range from kindergarten to
                        4th
                        grade academically in both ELA and Math, with grades 3-5
                        covering levels from K to 4. Many students are
                        functioning
                        at grade levels ranging from K to 1. The class faces
                        significant behavioral challenges, with each student
                        having
                        an IEP. Two students exhibit autism, others exhibit
                        multiple
                        disabilities, and emotional/behavioral issues, often
                        leading
                        to frequent outbursts. Both academic and emotional
                        challenges make teaching difficult, as disruptions occur
                        due
                        to emotional struggles. Despite these obstacles, some
                        students have shown progress.

                                By using a variety of assessments throughout the
                                year, I can gather comprehensive data on
                                students' academic performance, growth, and
                                areas of need. This information enables me to

                                support to students, and make data-driven
                                decisions to improve learning outcomes.
                                Additionally, regular assessments help students
                                monitor their own progress, set goals, and take
                                ownership of their learning journey

                                    a powerful way to promote metacognition and
                                    ownership of learning outcomes. Students can
                                    assess their understanding, skills, and

                                    improvement, and setting goals for future
                                    learning. Self-assessment activities might

                                    self-evaluation rubrics. By engaging in
                                    self-assessment, students become more aware

                                    Peer assessment can take various forms, such

                        setting goals, and reflecting on their learning

                        To observe and learn about effective organizational
                        structures, grouping strategies, and classroom
                        management techniques from a colleague's classroom.
                        <br><br>
                        During the visit, I observed how the teacher
                        effectively managed her classroom through clear
                        organizational structures and group rotations. The
                        teacher utilized a variety of grouping strategies to
                        differentiate instruction and promote collaborative
                        work among students. Specifically, I assisted a
                        first-grade teacher in setting up her group
                        rotations, which allowed for targeted instruction
                        and individualized support for students. I also
                        observed how the teacher fostered positive social
                        interactions among students, creating a supportive
                        learning environment.
                        <br><br>
                        Overall, I found the visit to be highly beneficial
                        in gaining new insights and techniques for
                        organizing and managing my own classroom. The
                        collaborative nature of the visit allowed for the
                        sharing of best practices and the opportunity to
                        learn from each other's experiences.

                        Based on the activities described above, I believe I
                        demonstrated strong leadership qualities in terms of
                        honesty, integrity, and confidentiality. I actively
                        sought out opportunities to learn from my colleagues
                        and
                        contributed to the professional growth of others by
                        assisting in setting up group rotations.
                        Furthermore, I am highly proactive in serving
                        students,
                        as evidenced by my willingness to seek out resources
                        and
                        learn new techniques to better meet their needs. I
                        also
                        make a concerted effort to challenge negative
                        attitudes
                        or practices to ensure that all students, especially
                        those traditionally underserved, are honored in the
                        school.
                        <br><br>
                        In terms of leadership in team and departmental
                        decision-making, I actively participate in
                        collaborative
                        discussions and contribute to the development of
                        high
                        professional standards. Additionally, I consistently
                        comply with school and district regulations and take
                        a
                        leadership role in ensuring that colleagues also
                        adhere
                        to these standards.
                        Overall, I believe I have demonstrated strong
                        leadership
                        qualities and a commitment to continuous improvement
                        in
                        my teaching practice.

                        and Reflection:</h2>
                    <p>
                        I am proud of my active participation in school events,
                        activities, committees, and trips. My relationships with
                        colleagues are characterized by mutual support and
                        cooperation, as demonstrated by my involvement in the
                        Graduation Committee and other school-wide initiatives.
                        By creating a DonorsChoose project for graduation
                        decorations, I made a tangible contribution to enhancing
                        the school's environment and celebrating student
                        achievements.
                        <br><br>
                        Additionally, I regularly volunteer for school events
                        such as Thanksgiving turkey distribution, back-to-school
                        community engagement activities, and field trips. These
                        efforts contribute to a positive school culture and
                        foster a sense of community among students, families,
                        and staff.
                        <br><br>
                        Furthermore, my involvement in professional development
                        activities, such as participating in the School
                        Leadership Team (SLT), reflects my commitment to
                        continuous growth and professional inquiry. By actively
                        engaging in school and district projects, I strive to
                        make a substantial contribution to the school community
                        and support its overall mission and goals.
                        <br><br>
                        Overall, I am dedicated to actively participating in
                        school events and projects, fostering collaboration and
                        inquiry, and making meaningful contributions to the
                        school community.

                        An organized classroom environment is essential for
                        effective teaching and learning. It reduces
                        distractions, promotes clarity, and maximizes
                        instructional time. With clear systems for materials and
                        routines, students feel secure and can focus on their
                        learning. Smooth transitions between activities enhance
                        efficiency, while digital organization streamlines
                        lesson preparation. Overall, an organized classroom
                        fosters a positive and productive learning environment
                        where both teachers and students can thrive.
                        <br><br>
                        Visual schedules, anchor charts, behavior charts, and
                        easily accessible materials play a crucial role in
                        creating an inclusive and supportive classroom
                        environment. They provide clear structure and
                        organization, which is essential for promoting student
                        independence, reducing anxiety, and fostering positive
                        behavior.
                        <br><br>
                        Visual schedules help students understand the sequence
                        of activities throughout the day, enabling them to
                        anticipate transitions and manage their time
                        effectively. This promotes a sense of predictability and
                        security, especially for students who may struggle with
                        uncertainty or change.
                        <br><br>
                        Anchor charts serve as visual aids to reinforce key
                        concepts and learning objectives. They provide students
                        with quick reference points for important information,
                        vocabulary, and strategies, enhancing comprehension and
                        retention of content.
                        <br><br>
                        Behavior charts offer a visual representation of
                        students' behavior expectations and progress. They
                        provide a framework for positive reinforcement and
                        accountability, encouraging students to take ownership
                        of their actions and make responsible choices.
                        Ensuring that materials are easily accessible further
                        supports student independence and engagement. When
                        students can easily access resources such as textbooks,
                        manipulatives, and art supplies, they are empowered to
                        take initiative in their learning and explore concepts
                        at their own pace.
                        <br><br>
                        Overall, visual schedules, anchor charts, behavior
                        charts, and accessible materials create a structured and
                        supportive learning environment where all students can
                        thrive academically, socially, and emotionally. They
                        promote organization, clarity, and accountability,
                        facilitating meaningful learning experiences for every
                        student.

                        In designing coherent instruction, I carefully align
                        learning objectives with engaging activities and
                        resources to create meaningful learning experiences for
                        students. Reflecting on teaching, I assess
                        effectiveness, citing specific examples, and provide
                        thoughtful suggestions for improvement, drawing on a

                    <p>
                        Receiving feedback on my classroom practices is always
                        valuable, and I'm pleased to hear that my efforts to
                        foster a supportive and collaborative learning
                        environment are making a positive impact on classroom
                        dynamics. The utilization of peer assessment not only
                        engages students but also helps them develop critical
                        skills like communication and constructive feedback.
                        <br><br>
                        However, the feedback also highlights an area for
                        improvement: student questioning during morning
                        meetings. Encouraging students to ask insightful
                        questions is crucial for deepening their understanding
                        and fostering curiosity. By facilitating meaningful
                        dialogue, we can empower students to become active
                        learners and critical thinkers.
                        <br><br>
                        I appreciate the suggestion to explore innovative
                        strategies for stimulating student questioning, such as
                        open-ended discussions or multimedia resources. I'm
                        committed to creating an environment where curiosity
                        thrives, and I'll work on incorporating these ideas into
                        our morning meetings to further enrich our learning
                        experiences.
                        <br><br>
                        Overall, I'm grateful for the feedback and excited to
                        continue growing and developing alongside my students.

                        - Formal Observation-Special Education Art Teacher</h2>
                    <p>
                        In this observation of my role as an art teacher, I
                        received an effective rating in Demonstrating knowledge
                        of content and pedagogy, and a highly effective rating
                        for fostering a classroom environment that promotes
                        respect and rapport. These ratings reflect my dedication
                        to incorporating feedback from previous observations and
                        continuously improving my teaching practices. Through
                        the use of visual aids and technology, I have
                        established an inclusive learning environment where all
                        students can actively participate. My proactive approach
                        to behavior management ensures a conducive atmosphere
                        for learning, and my questioning techniques encourage
                        critical thinking and meaningful discussion among
                        students. I am committed to ongoing professional growth
                        and actively seek opportunities to contribute to the
                        school community. Overall, I take pride in the positive
                        learning environment I have cultivated and remain
                        dedicated to further enhancing my teaching skills.

                        - Informal Observation-First Observation As An Art
                        Teacher</h2>
                    <p>
                        My first observation as an art teacher provided valuable
                        insights into my classroom practices. While there were
                        some areas of strength, such as creating an environment
                        of respect and rapport, there were also areas identified
                        for improvement.
                        <br><br>
                        In terms of demonstrating knowledge of content and
                        pedagogy, it became evident that my lesson plan lacked
                        specificity and alignment with grade-level standards.
                        Moving forward, I need to ensure that my lesson plans
                        are more tailored to the needs of my students, including
                        clear learning objectives and strategies to measure
                        mastery.
                        <br><br>
                        Similarly, while my instruction was coherent and
                        students were engaged, there is room to diversify my
                        teaching strategies to accommodate all learners and
                        consistently reach assessment targets. Incorporating a
                        variety of learning strategies, such as cue cards or
                        visual aids, can help ensure that all students are able
                        to understand and participate in the learning process
                        effectively.
                        <br><br>
                        Additionally, the feedback highlighted the importance of
                        implementing a feedback mechanism in the classroom to
                        help students monitor their behavior. Creating
                        opportunities for student interaction during small group
                        activities and aligning instruction with individualized
                        education plan (IEP) goals will also be essential moving
                        forward.
                        <br><br>
                        Overall, this observation has provided me with valuable
                        insights into areas where I can enhance my teaching
                        practices. I am committed to incorporating these
                        suggestions into my future lessons to create a more
                        inclusive and effective learning environment for all my
                        students.
