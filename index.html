                            My journey as an educator began long before my
                            tenure within the Department of Education (DOE).
                            Prior to joining the DOE, I operated a daycare for
                            seven years and authored two children's books,
                            "You Are" and "Imagine," which I self-published. In
                            addition to my entrepreneurial pursuits, I initiated
                            a community garden project and actively engaged with
                            children at the local community center and
                            elementary school.
                        </p>
                        <p class="hero-text">
                            During this time, I also conducted workshops on
                            writing, character development, and anti-bullying
                            efforts in collaboration with the community center
                            and elementary schools. My entry into the DOE
                            followed a less conventional path, starting as a
                            substitute teacher while pursuing my Master's degree
                            in General and Special Education.

                        <p class="hero-text" style="margin-bottom: 10px;">My
                            transition to full-time teaching
                            coincided with the onset of the COVID-19 pandemic
                            and a period of social unrest marked by protests and
                            riots. Despite these challenges, I embraced remote
                            teaching with resilience and creativity, striving to
                            maintain a supportive and engaging learning
                            environment for my students. This period underscored
                            my commitment to adaptability and innovative
                            teaching strategies in the face of adversity.</p>

                                The purpose of education, as articulated by
                                Cohen
                                (2014), takes a philosophical approach, rooted
                                in
                                the aims and aspirations of
                                "our 'Founding Fathers'"
                                (p. 43). He posits that K-12 education,
                                including
                                character education, aims to foster skills,
                                knowledge, and dispositions that form the basis
                                for
                                the ability to love, work, and participate in a
                                democracy (p. 43). Similarly, the role of an
                                educator parallels that of a parent, guiding
                                children through the world by both telling and
                                showing them, providing hands-on experiences
                                that
                                connect learning to real-life issues. This
                                approach
                                not only equips students with career-relevant
                                skills
                                but also imbues their future endeavors with
                                purpose
                                (Alismail & McGuire, 2015).
                                <br><br>
                                In my personal philosophy of education, key
                                principles such as patience, understanding,
                                fairness, and familial influence guide my
                                practice.
                                Acknowledging the diverse family dynamics from
                                which
                                students emerge is essential, as it profoundly
                                shapes their identity and educational journey.
                                Fairness, in treating each child equitably while
                                catering to their individual needs, builds trust
                                and
                                ensures that no student feels overlooked or
                                marginalized. Drawing from my own experiences as
                                a
                                student, I recognize the importance of attentive
                                teaching that values every student's voice and
                                potential.
                                <br><br>
                                Working with children entails affording them the
                                space to make mistakes, learn, and grow.
                                Patience is
                                paramount in navigating challenges, allowing for
                                the
                                fostering of critical thinking skills through
                                open-ended questioning. Dewey's philosophy
                                underscores the importance of teaching children
                                how
                                to think rather than what to think, facilitating
                                continuous reconstruction of experience (Hall,
                                Quinn, & Gollnick, 2014). Understanding how each
                                student learns enables tailored instruction that
                                maximizes their potential, emphasizing
                                engagement
                                and authentic learning experiences.
                                <br><br>
                                Furthermore, embracing diversity in the
                                classroom
                                enriches the learning environment, providing
                                opportunities for cultural exchange and
                                understanding. Recognizing the various learning
                                styles and backgrounds of students fosters
                                inclusive
                                teaching practices that promote trust and
                                respect.
                                Addressing disparities stemming from
                                socioeconomic
                                status, family structure, or cultural
                                differences
                                requires sensitivity and proactive support to
                                ensure
                                that every child has equal access to educational
                                opportunities.
                                <br><br>
                                In conclusion, effective teaching transcends a
                                one-size-fits-all approach, acknowledging the
                                multifaceted nature of student identity and
                                experience. By embracing diversity and
                                individuality, educators can create inclusive
                                learning environments that nurture curiosity,
                                understanding, and academic success.

                        height="300px">Effective communication between parents,
                    teachers, and
                    students forms the cornerstone of a successful educational
                    journey. When parents are actively engaged in their child's
                    schooling, they gain insight into their academic progress,
                    challenges, and achievements. This
                    collaboration allows
                    teachers to tailor their instruction to meet individual
                    needs, fostering a supportive learning environment.
                    Moreover, students benefit from the consistent message
                    conveyed by both home and school, reinforcing the importance
                    of education and encouraging a sense of responsibility for
                    their learning. By embracing open and transparent
                    communication, parents, teachers, and students form a
                    cohesive team dedicated to academic excellence and personal
                    growth.

                        height="400px">To provide frequent information to
                    families about the
                    instructional program, I utilize a variety of channels such
                    as newsletters, emails, parent-teacher conferences, and
                    online platforms like Class Dojo or ParentSquare.
                    Additionally, I involve students in preparing materials for
                    their families by assigning projects or presentations that
                    require them to communicate their learning and achievements.
                    This not only enhances student engagement but also empowers
                    them to take ownership of their education and share their
                    progress with their families.

                        height="400px">To ensure families are regularly informed
                    about student
                    progress, I implement a transparent communication system
                    that includes regular updates on grades, assessments, and
                    behavior. Students play a key role in designing this system,
                    providing input on how they prefer to showcase their
                    progress and what information they believe is important for
                    their families to know. By involving students in the
                    process, we create a more personalized and meaningful
                    communication approach.

                        height="400px"> I prioritize
                    professionalism and cultural sensitivity. I actively listen
                    to their concerns, validate their perspectives, and strive
                    to find solutions collaboratively. I make efforts to
                    understand and respect the cultural backgrounds and values
                    of each family, adapting my communication style and approach
                    accordingly. Building trust and rapport with families is
                    paramount, and I ensure that every interaction is conducted
                    with empathy, respect, and a genuine commitment to
                    addressing their needs and concerns.

                    Various forms of communication have been employed to reach

                        In my 12:1:1 class, students range from kindergarten to
                        4th
                        grade academically in both ELA and Math, with grades 3-5
                        covering levels from K to 4. Many students are
                        functioning
                        at grade levels ranging from K to 1. The class faces
                        significant behavioral challenges, with each student
                        having
                        an IEP. Two students exhibit autism, others exhibit
                        multiple
                        disabilities, and emotional/behavioral issues, often
                        leading
                        to frequent outbursts. Both academic and emotional
                        challenges make teaching difficult, as disruptions occur
                        due
                        to emotional struggles. Despite these obstacles, some

                                    assessments, assignments, and class
                                    participation to reinforce positive
                                    behaviors, address misconceptions, and
                                    suggest areas for improvement. Feedback
                                    should be specific, actionable, and focused
                                    on helping students achieve learning goals.
                                    It can be delivered verbally, written on
                                    assignments, or provided through digital
                                    platforms. Additionally, I can use feedback
                                    conversations as opportunities to engage
                                    students in dialogue about their learning
                                    progress, goals, and strategies for
                                    improvement.

                                By integrating student self-assessment,
                                peer-to-peer assessment, and teacher feedback
                                into the assessment process, it allows me to
                                create a more holistic approach to evaluating
                                student learning. This approach empowers
                                students to take an active role in their own
                                learning, fosters collaboration and
                                communication skills, and provides targeted
                                support and guidance for continued growth and
                                achievement.

                    <p class="sl-s" style="margin-bottom: 3rem;">
                        For tracking student progress in learning, I employ
                        a comprehensive system that includes regular
                        assessments, progress reports, and student
                        self-reflection. Students contribute information by
                        self-assessing their understanding of concepts,
                        setting goals, and reflecting on their learning
                        journey. During conferences or checkpoints, students
                        participate in interpreting their records by
                        discussing their strengths, areas for growth, and
                        strategies for improvement. This collaborative
                        approach fosters student agency and empowers them to
                        take ownership of their learning process.
